# SmoothShot

# Idea & Purpose
- While professional-grade rigs exist, they’re often bulky and prohibitively expensive. 
- SmoothShot aims to fill that gap by offering a compact, low-cost alternative that automates camera movements like pans, tilts, and tracking shots with precision.
- Using a joystick and a set of motors, our system can be programmed to follow exact motion paths — perfect for repeated shots, time-lapses, or stop-motion animation. - Whether you're filming short films, creative reels, or DIY videos, SmoothShot gives creators more control without breaking the bank.

# What It Does
- The SmoothShot is a maneuverable camera module.
- The joystick controls the movement of the rig with the camera attached.


# How We Built It
- Arduino
- 3D Printed Materials

# Challenges
- Connecting a variety of Arduino components & getting them to fit into one central mechanism.
- Pairing the joy sticks to control the movement through the stepper motor.
- Constructing the camera and movable components so that the weight and movement are balanced.
- Getting the Raspberry Pi configured & connecting the camera to the Raspberry Pi.

# Accomplishments
- 3D printing accommodating components to make a rig to hold & move the camera module.
- Getting the joystick to maneuver the overall position of the camera from left to right.
- 2 degree camera movement going left to right and at different angles.

# What We Learned
- How to link multiple components to the Arduino (joystick, stepper motors, 8x8 LED dot matrix.
- How to 3D print parts to align with specific measurements.

# What's next for SmoothShot!
- Pairing the raspberry pi with the arducam.
- Capturing pictures and videos using the Raspberry Pi.
- Finding a way to efficiently store captured pictures and photos.
